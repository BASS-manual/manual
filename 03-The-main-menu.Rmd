# The main menu

All functionality in the BASS administration interface can be accessed from the main menu to the left of your screen. 

Which options are visible in the main menu depends on your authorization level. A usual setup is that one administrator manages the available instruments and assessments, while several therapists manage their own participants and individual treatments.
