# Online resource for therapists using OCD-NET and BDD-NET

Treatment manuals and other resources for therapists using OCD-NET and BDD-NET. We have a separate repository for materials related to the treatment platform itself.

The repository is maintained by Oskar Flygare, Lic. Psychologist and PhD student in psychiatry at Karolinska Institutet (oskar.flygare [at] ki.se || @oskarflygare).

Other personnel are Christian Rück (christian.ruck [at] ki.se), Brjánn Ljótsson (brjann.ljotsson [at] ki.se), Jesper Enander (jesper.enander [at] ki.se) and Erik Andersson (erik.m.andersson [at] ki.se).
