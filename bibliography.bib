  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment
for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). However, most sufferers do not have
access to this treatment. One way to increase access to CBT is to
administer treatment remotely via the Internet. This study piloted a novel
therapist-supported, Internet-based CBT program for BDD (BDD-NET). DESIGN:
Uncontrolled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=23) were recruited
through self-referral and assessed face to face at a clinic specialising
in obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Suitable patients were
offered secure access to BDD-NET. INTERVENTION: BDD-NET is a 12-week
treatment program based on current psychological models of BDD that
includes psychoeducation, functional analysis, cognitive restructuring,
exposure and response prevention, and relapse prevention modules. A
dedicated therapist provides active guidance and feedback throughout the
entire process. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The clinician-administered
Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for BDD (BDD-YBOCS). Symptom
severity was assessed pretreatment, post-treatment and at the 3-month
follow-up. RESULTS: BDD-NET was deemed highly acceptable by patients and
led to significant improvements on the BDD-YBOCS (p={$<$}0.001) with a large
within-group effect size (Cohen's d=2.01, 95\% CI 1.05 to 2.97). At
post-treatment, 82\% of the patients were classified as responders (defined
as{$\geq$}30\% improvement on the BDD-YBOCS). These gains were maintained at the
3-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures of depression, global
functioning and quality of life also showed significant improvements with
moderate to large effect sizes. On average, therapists spent 10 min per
patient per week providing support. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that
BDD-NET has the potential to greatly increase access to CBT, at least for
low-risk individuals with moderately severe BDD symptoms and reasonably
good insight. A randomised controlled trial of BDD-NET is warranted. TRIAL

  volume = {58},
  issn = {0005-7967},
  abstract = {Exposure therapy is an effective approach for treating anxiety disorders,
although a substantial number of individuals fail to benefit or experience
a return of fear after treatment. Research suggests that anxious
individuals show deficits in the mechanisms believed to underlie exposure
therapy, such as inhibitory learning. Targeting these processes may help
improve the efficacy of exposure-based procedures. Although evidence
supports an inhibitory learning model of extinction, there has been little
discussion of how to implement this model in clinical practice. The
primary aim of this paper is to provide examples to clinicians for how to
apply this model to optimize exposure therapy with anxious clients, in
ways that distinguish it from a 'fear habituation' approach and 'belief
disconfirmation' approach within standard cognitive-behavior therapy.
Exposure optimization strategies include 1) expectancy violation, 2)
deepened extinction, 3) occasional reinforced extinction, 4) removal of
safety signals, 5) variability, 6) retrieval cues, 7) multiple contexts,
and 8) affect labeling. Case studies illustrate methods of applying these
techniques with a variety of anxiety disorders, including
obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, social
phobia, specific phobia, and panic disorder.},

  abstract = {Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a severe and disabling clinical condition
that usually arises in late adolescence or early adulthood and, if left
untreated, has a chronic course. Whether this disorder should be
classified as an anxiety disorder or in a group of putative
obsessive-compulsive-related disorders is still a matter of debate.
Biological models of obsessive-compulsive disorder propose anomalies in
the serotonin pathway and dysfunctional circuits in the orbito-striatal
area and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Support for these models is mixed
and they do not account for the symptomatic heterogeneity of the disorder.
The cognitive-behavioural model of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which
has some empirical support but does not fully explain the disorder,
emphasises the importance of dysfunctional beliefs in individuals
affected. Both biological and cognitive models have led to empirical
treatments for the disorder-ie, serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and various
forms of cognitive-behavioural therapy. New developments in the treatment
of obsessive-compulsive disorder involve medications that work in
conjuction with cognitive-behavioural therapy, the most promising of which
is D-cycloserine.},

  abstract = {Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by maladaptive
patterns of repetitive, inflexible cognition and behavior that suggest a
lack of cognitive flexibility. Consistent with this clinical observation,
many neurocognitive studies suggest behavioral and neurobiological
abnormalities in cognitive flexibility in individuals with OCD.
Meta-analytic reviews support a pattern of cognitive inflexibility, with
effect sizes generally in the medium range. Heterogeneity in assessments
and the way underlying constructs have been operationalized point to the
need for better standardization across studies, as well as more refined
overarching models of cognitive flexibility and executive function (EF).
Neuropsychological assessments of cognitive flexibility include measures
of attentional set shifting, reversal and alternation, cued task-switching
paradigms, cognitive control measures such as the Trail-Making and Stroop
tasks, and several measures of motor inhibition. Differences in the
cognitive constructs and neural substrates associated with these measures
suggest that performance within these different domains should be examined
separately. Additional factors, such as the number of consistent trials
prior to a shift and whether a shift is explicitly signaled or must be
inferred from a change in reward contingencies, may influence performance,
and thus mask or accentuate deficits. Several studies have described
abnormalities in neural activation in the absence of differences in
behavioral performance, suggesting that our behavioral probes may not be
adequately sensitive, but also offering important insights into potential
compensatory processes. The fact that deficits of moderate effect size are
seen across a broad range of classic neuropsychological tests in OCD
presents a conceptual challenge, as clinical symptomatology suggests
greater specificity. Traditional cognitive probes may not be sufficient to
delineate specific domains of deficit in this and other neuropsychiatric
disorders; a new generation of behavioral tasks that test more specific
underlying constructs, supplemented by neuroimaging to provide insight
into the underlying processes, may be needed.},

  abstract = {Why do we repeat choices that we know are bad for us? Decision making is
characterized by the parallel engagement of two distinct systems,
goal-directed and habitual, thought to arise from two computational
learning mechanisms, model-based and model-free. The habitual system is a
candidate source of pathological fixedness. Using a decision task that
measures the contribution to learning of either mechanism, we show a bias
towards model-free (habit) acquisition in disorders involving both natural
(binge eating) and artificial (methamphetamine) rewards, and
obsessive-compulsive disorder. This favoring of model-free learning may
underlie the repetitive behaviors that ultimately dominate in these
disorders. Further, we show that the habit formation bias is associated
with lower gray matter volumes in caudate and medial orbitofrontal cortex.
Our findings suggest that the dysfunction in a common neurocomputational
mechanism may underlie diverse disorders involving compulsion.Molecular

  abstract = {Obsessive\textendash{}compulsive disorder (OCD) has become a paradigmatic case of goal-directed dysfunction in psychiatry. In this article, we review the neurobiological evidence, historical and recent, that originally led to this supposition and continues to support a habit hypothesis of OCD. We will then discuss a number of recent studies that have directly tested this hypothesis, using behavioural experiments in patient populations. Based on this research evidence, which suggests that rather than goal-directed avoidance behaviours, compulsions in OCD may derive from manifestations of excessive habit formation, we present the details of a novel account of the functional relationship between these habits and the full symptom profile of the disorder. Borrowing from a cognitive dissonance framework, we propose that the irrational threat beliefs (obsessions) characteristic of OCD may be a consequence, rather than an instigator, of compulsive behaviour in these patients. This lays the foundation for a potential shift in both clinical and neuropsychological conceptualization of OCD and related disorders. This model may also prove relevant to other putative disorders of compulsivity, such as substance dependence, where the experience of `wanting' drugs may be better understood as post hoc rationalizations of otherwise goal-insensitive, stimulus-driven behaviour.},

  abstract = {Introduction Expert guidelines recommend cognitive\textendash{}behavioural therapy (CBT) as a first-line treatment for obsessive\textendash{}compulsive disorder (OCD), but the majority of patients with OCD do not have access to CBT. Internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) has the potential to make this evidence-based treatment more accessible while requiring less therapist time than traditional face-to-face (f2f) CBT. Data from six clinical trials suggest that ICBT for OCD is both efficacious and cost-effective, but whether ICBT is non-inferior to traditional f2f CBT for OCD is yet unknown.
Methods and analysis A single-blind, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial comparing therapist-guided ICBT, unguided ICBT and individual (f2f) CBT for adult OCD patients. The primary objective is to investigate whether ICBT is non-inferior to gold standard f2f CBT. Secondary objectives are to investigate if ICBT is equally effective when delivered unguided, to establish the cost-effectiveness of ICBT and to investigate if the treatment outcome differs between self-referred and clinically referred patients. Participants will be recruited at two specialist OCD clinics in Stockholm and also through online self-referral. Participants will be randomised to one of three treatment conditions: F2f CBT, ICBT with therapist support or unguided ICBT. The total number of participants will be 120, and masked assessments will be administered at baseline, biweekly during treatment, at post-treatment and at 3-month and 12-month follow-ups. The main outcome measure is the clinician-rated Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at 3-month follow-up. The margin of non-inferiority is set to 3 points on the Y-BOCS using a 90\% CI.
Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the Regional Ethics Board of Stockholm (REPN 2015/1099-31/2) and registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02541968). The study will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement for non-pharmacological trials. The results will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals and disseminated to patient organisations and media.

  abstract = {Objectives Most patients with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) do not receive evidence-based treatment. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) has found that a therapist-guided internet-based cognitive\textendash{}behavioural therapy (CBT) programme for BDD (BDD-NET) can be delivered safely via the internet with significant improvements in BDD symptom severity in the short term. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if the therapeutic gains of BDD-NET are maintained 2 years after treatment.
Setting Academic medical centre.
Participants A naturalistic 2-year follow-up study of the 88 self-referred adult outpatients with a diagnosis of BDD that had received BDD-NET within the context of the RCT.
Primary and secondary outcomes The primary outcome was the BDD-Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). Responder status was defined as a {$\geq$}30\% reduction in symptoms. Remission was defined as no longer meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition criteria for BDD. Secondary outcomes included measures of depression, global functioning and quality of life.
Results The efficacy of BDD-NET was sustained long- term, with further improvements observed on the BDD-YBOCS during the follow-up period. At follow-up, 69\% (95\% CI 57\% to 80\%) were classified as responders and 56\% (95\% CI 43\% to 69\%) were in remission. Gains on depressive symptoms and global functioning were also sustained but not quality of life. A majority of participants reported that the main reason for seeking help for their BDD was the possibility to access the treatment from home.
Conclusion BDD-NET is an effective treatment for BDD, and the patients' gains are maintained in the long term. BDD-NET has the potential to increase access to CBT and may lower the threshold for BDD sufferers to seek help in the first place.

The authors are experts on BDD and related conditions. They describe ways to engage patients who believe they have defects or flaws in their appearance, not a psychological problem. Provided are clear-cut strategies for helping patients overcome the self-defeating thoughts, impairments in functioning, and sometimes dangerous ritualistic behaviors that are core features of BDD. Clinician-friendly features include step-by-step instructions for conducting each session and more than 50 reproducible handouts and forms; the large-size format facilitates photocopying.

  abstract = {Background
As relapse after completed cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for obsessive\textendash{}compulsive disorder (OCD) is common, many treatment protocols include booster programs to improve the long-term effects. However, the effects of booster programs are not well studied. In this study, we investigated the long-term efficacy of Internet-based CBT (ICBT) with therapist support for OCD with or without an Internet-based booster program.

Method
A total of 101 participants were included in the long-term follow-up analysis of ICBT. Of these, 93 were randomized to a booster program or no booster program. Outcome assessments were collected at 4, 7, 12 and 24 months after receiving ICBT.

Results
The entire sample had sustained long-term effects from pre-treatment to all follow-up assessments, with large within-group effect sizes (Cohen's d~=~1.58\textendash{}2.09). The booster group had a significant mean reduction in OCD symptoms compared to the control condition from booster baseline (4 months) to 7 months, but not at 12 or 24 months. Participants in the booster group improved significantly in terms of general functioning at 7, 12 and 24 months, and had fewer relapses. Kaplan\textendash{}Meier analysis also indicated a significantly slower relapse rate in the booster group.

Conclusions
The results suggest that ICBT has sustained long-term effects and that adding an Internet-based booster program can further improve long-term outcome and prevent relapse for some OCD patients.},

Treatment led to highly statistical and significant improvements on all measures. Massed exposure was as effective as spaced exposure; self-controlled exposure proved to be as effective as therapist-controlled exposure.},
