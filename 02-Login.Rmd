# Login {#login}

As soon as your database setup is ready, you can login to the administratorâ€™s interface. The interface is found at an URL of the format `https://NameOfYourDatabase-admin.webcbt.se/` or `https://NameOfYourDatabase-admin.bassdb.se/`. 
<br>
You will have your login credentials supplied by us, and logging in will require 2FA (two-factor authentication) through either SMS or through an authenticator app (Authy, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator).
<br>
Enter your credentials in the login box and press the Login button.

After this you will be taken to a page for double authentication. The code could arrive to you by sms or email depending on how your database is set up.
