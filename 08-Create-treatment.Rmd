# Create new treatment 

BASS is designed to allow you to conduct mental healthcare and psychological studies through online channels. The main feature to achieve this in BASS, is the treatment.<br>
A treatment is built by combining *treatment modules* into sections. A module is in essence a website, contained within the framework that BASS provides. This allows you the flexibility to build your treatment according to your organization's needs and wishes.

Treatments are accessed by the **Treatment containers** option in the main menu.

The first thing you will see in this view is a table showing you all the existing treatment containers in the current project. If no treatment containers have been created, the table will be empty.<br>
You can edit existing treatment containers by clicking the *Edit* link in the column to the right.<br>
To create new treatment containers, click the *Create new treatment container* link below the table.

>**Important note:** *Treatment containers* in BASS are frameworks that contain all the other components that make up a treatment, such as treatment modules.

## A typical treatment structure
A **treatment container** is the abstract structure that holds all the content of a treatment or treatment series. A typical **treatment** is built up by several modules, often arranged in a specific order. A typical **module** consits of:

- One *module text*
- (0 - several) *worksheets*
- One *homework*

Whenever you create a new treatment, it is advisable to plan the structure from the beginning, so as to get a sense of both the magnitude of the sub-content and the flow of the treatment.

## Creating a treatment container
In the **Treatment containers** view, click the *Create new treatment container* link below the table. This opens the editing view of the new treatment container. You can close the container by clicking *Close* at the top to return to the table listing all existing treatment containers. Don't forget to save any changes first, by clicking the *Save* button.

Give your treatment container a name in the *Name* box, and save it.<br>
You can now add treatments, modules and specific contents such as texts, worksheets and homeworks to your treatment container, by using the dropdown menu at the bottom of the page.

## Creating a treatment
Regardless whether you just created a new treatment container or chose to edit an existing one, you can add a new treatment to it, by selecting *Create new... [Treatment]* in the dropdown menu ar the bottom of the view. This opens the editing view of the new treatment. You can close the treatment by clicking *Close* at the top of the view to return to the corresponding treatment container. Don't forget to save any changes before doing so, by clicking the *Save* button.

Give your treatment a name, by typing it into the *Name* box and save it.

Before adding in modules with content to the treatment, there are a few **Treatment settings** to consider.

### Available
By checking this box, the treatment can be assigned to participants.

>**Important note:** Any participants assigned to the treatment will automatically and continuously have access to all its content unless you limit the access with the settings below.

### Acces has to be enabled/time-limited access
If the *Access has to be enabled* box is checked, the treatment has to be manually activated for a participant before its content becomes available to that participant.

By alos checking the *Time-limited access* box, you can specify a time window for a participant when the treatment is active and its content available. This time window is specified in the participant view, under the **Treatments** tab.

### Treatment length
If the treatment is to be available for a certain numbre of days after it has been activated, you can set that value in the *Treatment length* box. You can always override/customize the treatment availability for a specific paricipant in the **Treatment access** tab of the participant.

### Manual model access
Check this box to be able to activate each module in the treatment separately for a participant. This is useful for when you want to make sure participants are finished with one module before starting with the next one.

### Participants can send messages
Checking this box makes it possible for participants to send messages to their therapists during an active treatment, by using the built-in messaging feature in BASS.

### Therapists can send messages
Checking this box makes it possible for therapists to send messages to their participants during an active treatment, by using the built-in messaging feature in BASS.

### Use homework review
Checking this box has two implications:

- First, a participant can choose to either save a homework (to be able to work on it later), or send it to the therapist (which marks it as finished and locks it, disabling further editing).
- Second, an icon will be displayed i the *Homework* column of the *Participant search* view, that flags whenever a participant has submitted a finished homework and thus notifies the therapists of the fact at a glance.

### Treatment modules
To add a module to a treatment, use the *Add modules* dropdown menu at the bottom of the treatment view. The dropdown menu will show all existing moduels of the corresponding treatment container. To create a new module, close the treatment to return to the treatment container view and click the *Create new... [Module]* from the dropdown menu at the bottom of the view.

To remove a module for the treatment, click *Remove* on the right hand side of the module name.

To change the order of modules in a treatment, use the *Move up* link in the table.

To set which modules are active/available from the start of the treatment (typically a welcome module and the first module in a treatment), check the corresponding boxes in the *Auto access* column.
